        <p>The behavior of GameObjects is controlled by the Components that are attached to them. Although Unity’s built-in Components can be very versatile, you will soon find you need to go beyond what they can provide to implement your own gameplay features.
          Unity allows you to create your own Components using scripts. These allow you to trigger game events, modify Component properties over time and respond to user input in any way you like.</p>

        <p>Unity supports the C# programming language natively. C# (pronounced C-sharp) is an industry-standard language similar to Java or C++.</p>

        <p>In addition to this, many other .NET languages can be used with Unity if they can compile a compatible DLL.</p>

        <p>Learning the art of programming and the use of these particular languages is beyond the scope of this introduction. However, there are many books, tutorials and other resources for learning how to program with Unity. See the <a href="http://unity3d.com/learn"
            target="_blank">Learning section</a> of our website for further details.</p>

        <header>Creating Scripts</header>
        <p>Unlike most other assets, scripts are usually created within Unity directly. You can create a new script from the Create menu at the top left of the Project panel or by selecting Assets > Create > C# Script from the main menu.</p>

        <img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/3f1jatyi1fihqlr/NewScriptIcon.png?dl=1" alt="icon for a new csharp script in unity">

        <p>The new script will be created in whichever folder you have selected in the Project panel. The new script file’s name will be selected, prompting you to enter a new name.</p>
        <div class="top-link"><a href="#top-anchor">Back to top</a></div>
      </section>
      <section id="anatomy_of_a_script_file" class="main-section">
        <header>Anatomy of a Script File</header>
        <p>When you double-click a script Asset in Unity, it will be opened in a text editor. By default, Unity will use Visual Studio, but you can select any editor you like from the External Tools panel in Unity’s preferences (go to Unity > Preferences).</p>

        <p>The initial contents of the file will look something like this:</p>
        <div class="code-box">
          <pre><code>using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;

public class MainPlayer : MonoBehaviour {

    // Use this for initialization
    void Start () {
    
    }
    
    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update () {
    
    }
        }</code></pre>
        </div>
        <p>A script makes its connection with the internal workings of Unity by implementing a class which derives from the built-in class called MonoBehaviour. You can think of a class as a kind of blueprint for creating a new Component type that can be
          attached to GameObjects. Each time you attach a script component to a GameObject, it creates a new instance of the object defined by the blueprint. The name of the class is taken from the name you supplied when the file was created. The class
          name and file name must be the same to enable the script component to be attached to a GameObject.</p>

        <div class="list-box">
          <ul>
            <li>Not every class needs to inherit from MonoBehavior.</li>
            <li>You can create a parent class that inherits from MonoBehavior.</li>
            <li>This keeps your class structure clean and allows your child classes to use the MonoBehavior methods.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>The main things to note, however, are the two functions defined inside the class. The Update function is the place to put code that will handle the frame update for the GameObject. This might include movement, triggering actions and responding
          to user input, basically anything that needs to be handled over time during gameplay. To enable the Update function to do its work, it is often useful to be able to set up variables, read preferences and make connections with other GameObjects
          before any game action takes place. The Start function will be called by Unity before gameplay begins (ie, before the Update function is called for the first time) and is an ideal place to do any initialization.</p>

        <p>Note to experienced programmers: you may be surprised that initialization of an object is not done using a constructor function. This is because the construction of objects is handled by the editor and does not take place at the start of gameplay
          as you might expect. If you attempt to define a constructor for a script component, it will interfere with the normal operation of Unity and can cause major problems with the project.</p>
        <div class="top-link"><a href="#top-anchor">Back to top</a></div>
      </section>

      <section id="controlling_a_gameobject" class="main-section">
        <header>Controlling a GameObject</header>
        <p>As noted above, a script only defines a blueprint for a Component and so none of its code will be activated until an instance of the script is attached to a GameObject. You can attach a script by dragging the script asset to a GameObject in the
          hierarchy panel or to the inspector of the GameObject that is currently selected.</p>
        <div class="list-box">
          <ul>
            <li>If the GameObject in the hierarchy is a prefab instance, you can drag the script on to it but you must click Apply for the script to attach itself to the prefab GameObject.
              <li>Doing so will create a script instance on every instantiated GameObject instance.
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>There is also a Scripts submenu on the Component menu which will contain all the scripts available in the project, including those you have created yourself. The script instance looks much like any other Component in the Inspector :
        </p>
        <img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ij1f61iao0h95r5/ScriptInInspector.png?dl=1" alt="script inpsector in unity editor">
        <p>Once attached, the script will start working when you press Play and run the game. You can check this by adding the following code in the Start function:</p>
        <div class="code-box">
          <pre><code>// Use this for initialization
void Start () 
{
    Debug.Log("I am alive!");
}</code></pre>
        </div>
        <p>Debug.Log is a simple command that just prints a message to Unity’s console output. If you press Play now, you should see the message at the bottom of the main Unity editor window and in the Console window (menu: Window > General > Console ).
        </p>

      <section id="variables_and_the_inspector" class="main-section">
        <header>Variables and the Inspector</header>
        <p>When creating a script, you are essentially creating your own new type of component that can be attached to Game Objects just like any other component.</p>

        <p>Just like other Components often have properties that are editable in the inspector, you can allow values in your script to be edited from the Inspector too.</p>
        <div class="code-box">
          <pre><code>using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;

public class MainPlayer : MonoBehaviour 
{
    public string myName;
    
    // Use this for initialization
    void Start () 
    {
        Debug.Log("I am alive and my name is " + myName);
    }
}</code></pre>
        </div>
        <p>This code creates an editable field in the Inspector labelled “My Name”.</p>
        <img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/738okwrhgrfszbi/EditingVarInspector.png?dl=1" alt="Displays an edittable field in the inspector window">
        <p>Unity creates the Inspector label by introducing a space wherever a capital letter occurs in the variable name. However, this is purely for display purposes and you should always use the variable name within your code. If you edit the name and
          then press Play, you will see that the message includes the text you entered.</p>
        <p>In C#, you must declare a variable as public to see it in the Inspector.</p>

        <p>Unity will actually let you change the value of a script’s variables while the game is running. This is very useful for seeing the effects of changes directly without having to stop and restart. When gameplay ends, the values of the variables
          will be reset to whatever they were before you pressed Play. This ensures that you are free to tweak your object’s settings without fear of doing any permanent damage.</p>

      <section id="controlling_gameobjects_using_components" class="main-section">
        <header>Controlling GameObjects using components</header>
        <p>In the Unity Editor, you make changes to Component properties using the Inspector. So, for example, changes to the position values of the Transform Component will result in a change to the GameObject’s position. Similarly, you can change the color
          of a Renderer’s material or the mass of a Rigidbody with a corresponding effect on the appearance or behavior of the GameObject. For the most part, scripting is also about modifying Component properties to manipulate GameObjects. The difference,
          though, is that a script can vary a property’s value gradually over time or in response to input from the user. By changing, creating and destroying objects at the right time, any kind of gameplay can be implemented.</p>
        <header>Accessing components</header>
        <p>The simplest and most common case is where a script needs access to other Components attached to the same GameObject. As mentioned in the Introduction section, a Component is actually an instance of a class so the first step is to get a reference
          to the Component instance you want to work with. This is done with the GetComponent function. Typically, you want to assign the Component object to a variable, which is done in C# using the following syntax:</p>
        <div class="code-box">
          <pre><code>
void Start () 
{
    Rigidbody rb = GetComponent&lt;Rigidbody>();
}</pre>
          </code>
        </div>
        <div class="list-box">
          <ul>
            <li>The GetComponent method is expensive in terms of flops. Use only when neccesary.</li>
            <li>Avoid wasting flops by assigning the result to a variable. In this example, we're using the RigidBody rb.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>Once you have a reference to a Component instance, you can set the values of its properties much as you would in the Inspector:</p>
        <div class="code-box">
          <pre><code>void Start () 
{
    Rigidbody rb = GetComponent&lt;Rigidbody>();
    
    // Change the mass of the object's Rigidbody.
    rb.mass = 10f;
}</pre>
          </code>
        </div>
        <p>An extra feature that is not available in the Inspector is the possibility of calling functions on Component instances:</p>
        <div class="code-box">
          <pre><code>void Start ()
{
    Rigidbody rb = GetComponent&lt;Rigidbody>();
    
    // Add a force to the Rigidbody.
    rb.AddForce(Vector3.up * 10f);
}</pre>
          </code>

        </div>
